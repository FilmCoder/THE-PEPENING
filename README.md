THE STORY
---------
A radical new visual look at the way the average Joe experiences an influx
of anime swags and 4chan bros into his life. For instance, perhaps Adam
Wellington the jock from the football team mistakenly stumbled into a
weekly meeting of the Anime club in the midst of a Nichijou viewing session.

Silence. The lights dim. Adam, for the first time in his life, feel truly 
terrified. The door slams shut behind him, and the eyes of 50 Pepe's drill
into him. Nichijou is paushed - silence.

Adam tries to speak but his mouth is dry. He mumbles nervously with his eyes
darting towards the ground "Oh geeez sorry, wrong room, I'll just be leaving
now..."

A SINGLE "REEEE", LOUD AND CLEAR AS AN EAGLE ON A SUMMERS DAY. AND THEN...

"KOROSHITE YARU!"

One of the freshmen was staring straight at him, bloodshot eyes, drooling.

Then.... "NORMIE!" he SCREAMED.

Adam stumbled backward and stuttered "wha - wha - whaaaat?"

Slowly, one after another, all of the Pepe's began adding their own Rees in,
until a earsplitting REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE drowned out the world.
The rage, hatred, the murdurous intent - it was so physical and real, and Adam
could feel his own head being crushed under the hatred of a thousand PEPES.

THEN, IN UNISOM, THEY ALL STARTED RUNNING TOWARDS HIM!!!!!!!

This is the story of ADAM WELLINGTON, a poor little normie trapped in a 
Pepe dungeon, clinging onto his dear life just so he can make it to the
next day to watch a little ESPN and maybe wind down afterwards with some 
Big Bang Theory.

Roadmap
-------
The game is in a VERY early state. Currently, we have a camera controlled by mouse, a basic pepe object
and a spawn manager to manage the spawning rates and areas of Pepes. We don't have much else. 

A high level roadmap looks like this:
1. Continue to develop in non-vr to add a little more depth to the game. Finish the first 3 waves.
2. Port to VR.
3. Add more waves, 10 waves is our goal. (keep in mind, we want new types of enemies or behavior at least every 2 waves.
   Just adding more enemies with more health isn't interesting enough. We want nice pepes, angry pepes, eagle pepes, etc...)
   
Detailed roadmap:
1. __Make Pepes shootable.__ (raycast shooting system, give health to pepes, have them dye).
2. __Create tendy gun.__
3. __Add particle effects.__ This game needs to be gory. Pepes explode blood and guts when shot.
4. __Create WaveManager.__ We need a better way to manage the timing of waves. We should be able to quickly
   insert new waves in front of existing waves, and link the WaveManager to the SpawnManager somehow.
5. __Design first 3 waves__. Lots of experimentation, make a new enemy type, play with visual effects
   and particle effects, play with Pepe speeds/animations. This is a really big step that will take a while.
6. __Design sounds.__ Start recording folley. Work with directional audio and audio effects processing.
6. __Port to VR__. Big boi.
7. __Design 7 more waves__.
8. FIN.
