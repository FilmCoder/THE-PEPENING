======================

A radical new visual look at the way the average Joe experiences an influx
of anime swags and 4chan bros into his life. For instance, perhaps Adam
Wellington the jock from the football team mistakenly stumbled into a
weekly meeting of the Anime club in the midst of a Nichijou viewing session.

Silence. The lights dim. Adam, for the first time in his life, feel truly 
terrified. The door slams shut behind him, and the eyes of 50 Pepe's drill
into him. Nichijou is paushed - silence.

Adam tries to speak but his mouth is dry. He mumbles nervously with his eyes
darting towards the ground "Oh geeez sorry, wrong room, I'll just be leaving
now..."

A SINGLE "REEEE", LOUD AND CLEAR AS AN EAGLE ON A SUMMERS DAY. AND THEN...

"KOROSHITE YARU!"

One of the freshmen was staring straight at him, bloodshot eyes, drooling.

Then.... "NORMIE!" he SCREAMED.

Adam stumbled backward and stuttered "wha - wha - whaaaat?"

Slowly, one after another, all of the Pepe's began adding their own Rees in,
until a earsplitting REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE drowned out the world.
That rage, hatred, the murdurous intent was so physical and real, and Adam
could feel his own head being crushed under the hatred of a thousand PEPES.

THEN, IN UNISOM, THEY ALL STARTED RUNNING TOWARDS HIM!!!!!!!

This is the story of ADAM WELLINGTON, a poor little normie trapped in a 
Pepe dungeon, clinging onto his dear life just so he can make it to the
next day to watch a little ESPN.
